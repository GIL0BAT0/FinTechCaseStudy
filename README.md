## Origin
Shopify began in 2004 as an online store called Snowdevil with the purpose of selling snowboard equipment. 

However the concept of Shopify as a SaaS began shortly after, and stemmed from the frustration encountered by the founders with the limiting, rudimentary, and oftern incompatible interface of web hosting sites such as Yahoo! Stores.

Armed with software engineering backgrounds, the founders set out to create a web hosting platform that was simple and easy to use for entrepreneurs and novice small businesses.

## Landscape and Business Activities

### FinTech Domain: Enterprise Solutions

As defined by the Gartner Glossary:

"Enterprise solutions are designed to integrate multiple facets of a company’s business through the interchange of information from various business process areas and related databases. These solutions enable companies to retrieve and disseminate mission-critical data throughout the organization, providing managers with real-time operating information." (Gartner, n.d.)

Using this definition, Shopify not only fits neatly into this domain, it is a dominating force. 
As the ecommerce market has expanded exponentially in the last ten years, customer centric solutions for online businesses that do not necessitate advance knowledge in coding, management, logistics, etc. has made Shopify's turnkey platform thrive in this domaine.

In fact, one of the key metrics used to gauge success since its inception has been MRR or Monthly Reoccurring Revenue. According to the founders, this metric is a great indicator of happy clients since their platform is on a subscription basis which means that a high number of business are consistently renewing.

The name brand companies and Fortune 500 companies that have come to rely on Shopify’s platform is staggering when considering how it’s original intent was small business. However, Shopify has not lost sight of this fact and continues to put out amazing tools for novice first time sellers to intermediate size businesses. As of 2022, over 1.7 million companies are hosted on Shopify with 2 million Shopify stores.

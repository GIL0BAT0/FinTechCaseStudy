## Origin
Shopify began in 2004 as an online store called Snowdevil with the purpose of selling snowboard equipment. 

However the concept of Shopify as a SaaS began shortly after, and stemmed from the frustration encountered by the founders with the limiting, rudimentary, and oftern incompatible interface of web hosting sites such as Yahoo! Stores.

Armed with software engineering backgrounds, the founders set out to create a web hosting platform that was simple and easy to use for novice small businesses and entreprenuers.

The coding language used by the founders is called Ruby and is used on Ruby on Rails -  a fullstack framework.
